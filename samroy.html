<p>
  Samurai (侍) or bushi (武士, [bɯ.ɕi]) were members of the warrior class in Japan. Originally provincial warriors who served the Kuge and imperial court in the late 12th century, they eventually came to play a major political role until their abolition in the late 1870s during the Meiji era.[1][2]
